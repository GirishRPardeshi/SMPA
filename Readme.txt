5.1 Introduction:
The Stock Market Performance Analysis project aims to provide users with insights into the performance of selected stocks over a specified time period. The application fetches historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance, analyzes key metrics such as price movements, volume, moving averages, volatility, and correlations, and presents the analysis results through interactive visualizations and news feeds. The system is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and scalable, catering to both novice and experienced investors seeking to make informed decisions in the stock market.

5.2 Preliminary Design:
The preliminary design of the system encompasses the user interface, data processing pipeline, visualization components, and system architecture. It outlines the functionality, interactions, and components of the application to achieve the project objectives effectively.

5.3 System Architecture:
The system architecture consists of the following components:

Frontend: Developed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. Handles user interactions, data visualization, and rendering of analysis results in real-time.
Backend: Includes data retrieval scripts, data processing modules, and APIs for fetching news articles and performing sentiment analysis. Orchestrates data flow and integrates with the frontend seamlessly.
Data Sources: Historical stock market data is fetched from Yahoo Finance, while news articles related to selected stocks are retrieved from various sources using the StockNews library.
Deployment Environment: The application is deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for scalability and accessibility. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the deployment process and ensure timely updates.

Certainly! Let‚Äôs tailor the explanations to the specifics of your project based on the Python code you‚Äôve shared. Here‚Äôs the revised testing section for your project report:

7. Testing
7.1 Preliminary Testing
During the initial stages of our project, we conducted preliminary testing to ensure that the basic functionalities were working as expected:

Feature Testing:
After implementing each feature, we ran the code to verify its correctness.
For our specific project (based on the provided Python code), let‚Äôs assume the following features:
Data retrieval from an external API (e.g., stock data).
Data processing and analysis.
We ensured that the data retrieval process worked without errors and that the fetched data aligned with our expectations.
7.2 Detail Testing
Once the basic functionalities were confirmed, we moved on to detailed testing:

Input Validation:
We tested the code with various inputs to ensure it could handle different scenarios.
For example:
Valid stock tickers (e.g., ‚ÄúAAPL,‚Äù ‚ÄúMSFT‚Äù).
Invalid tickers (e.g., ‚ÄúXYZ123,‚Äù ‚ÄúINVALID‚Äù).
Edge cases (e.g., non-existent tickers).
Different date ranges to verify accurate data retrieval.
We paid attention to how the code handled unexpected inputs.
Boundary Testing:
We explored boundary values to check how the code behaves near its limits.
For instance:
Testing the lowest and highest possible dates for stock data retrieval.
Considering extreme cases, such as requesting data for a very short time interval.
7.3 White Box Testing
White box testing involved examining the internal structure and logic of your code:

Code Logic Review:
We reviewed the code line by line to identify any logical errors.
Ensured that the flow of execution followed the intended logic.
Checked for potential areas of improvement, dead code, or unnecessary complexity.
Specifically, we looked at how data was processed, transformed, and analyzed within the code.
Branch Coverage:
We made sure that all branches of conditional statements were tested.
For example:
Error handling paths (e.g., handling exceptions related to API calls).
Data validation conditions (e.g., ensuring valid input before processing).
7.4 Black Box Testing
Black box testing assessed the functionality of the code without considering its internal structure:

Input-Output Verification:
We provided various inputs (stock tickers, date ranges) and verified if the outputs matched our expectations.
For instance:
Checking if the retrieved stock data aligned with the expected historical prices and volume.
Verifying that the processed data (e.g., calculated metrics) was accurate.
Scenario Testing:
We considered different scenarios, such as:
Fetching data for popular stocks (e.g., Apple, Microsoft).
Handling cases where data might be missing or incomplete (e.g., weekends, holidays).
Testing the code‚Äôs behavior during exceptional situations (e.g., API rate limits).
Remember to adapt these explanations to the specifics of your project. If you have additional questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
